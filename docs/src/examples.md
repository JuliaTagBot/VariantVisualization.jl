# Examples

## Default Options

Running VIVA with no options produces heatmaps of genotype and read depth values for all samples and variant positions in the VCF file with default options. You can read about VIVA's default settings [here](https://compbiocore.github.io/VariantVisualization.jl/stable/#default-options)

## Generate All VIVA Plots While Grouping Samples by Metadata Traits

Group samples by sequencing facility and generate heatmaps of genotype and read depth values as well as scatter plots of average read depth for both all selected samples and all selected variant positions. 

You can find grouping options [here]([options](https://compbiocore.github.io/VariantVisualization.jl/stable/filtering_vcf/#selecting-and-grouping-samples) to group samples by common traits.)
